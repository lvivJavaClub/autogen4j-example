You can calculate the number of days to the new year by subtracting today's date from the date of the next new year. Here is a Python code snippet that will do this:

```python
import datetime

# Get the current date
today = datetime.date.today()

# Calculate the date of the next new year
new_year = datetime.date(today.year + 1, 1, 1)

# Calculate the number of days to the new year
days_to_new_year = (new_year - today).days

# Print the number of days to the new year
print("There are", days_to_new_year, "days to the new year.")
```

Please run this code to get the number of days to the new year.
